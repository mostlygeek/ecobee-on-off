# ecobee-on-off
A little daemon that turns the ecobee on/off when the windows/doors are open.  This program is quite specific: 

1. Works with an [Envisalink](http://www.eyezon.com/?page_id=176) to check the state of sensors around the house
1. If certain sensors (windows, doors) are open it will turn off the ecobee
1. When windows/doors are closed it will turn the ecobee back on

This program is meant to let robots doing the boring work and stop heating/cooling the outside. :)
